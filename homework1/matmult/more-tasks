1- Write a python code that generates two dense matricies each of dimention N by N

2- Write a code that multiplies the two matricies and hand it in.

3- Decribe your algorithm, can you do better? If so, decribe your idea and write the code.

4- Develop a model for the communication cost of your algorithm. (hine: tile/block sizes in your algorithm will be the main parameters in your model)
